# Clown Hammer
A simple python game about killing clowns

## About
For school I had to write a game in python, so I created a simple game about destroying randomly appearing clowns with a hammer.

All textures are made by me with GIMP, sounds are created with [BFXR](http://www.bfxr.net), music with [BeepBox](http://www.beepbox.co).
As font I'm using [ModerDOS](https://www.dafont.com/moder-dos-437.font) created by Jayvee Enaguas.

## Play it
This was made with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org). So besides [Python 3](https://www.python.org) you need to `pip install pygame`.

Download or clone it and execute `main.py`.

## Story
I created a short ridiculous story told at the beginning of the game.

Your wife wants to go to the birthday party of her ex.

Her ex engaged some clowns to amuse his guests but you don't like your wife to have fun at her ex'.

So you try to stop the clowns.
